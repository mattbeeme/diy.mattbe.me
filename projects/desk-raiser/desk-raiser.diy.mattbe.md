### Desk-Raiser

My partners desk neede raising up at least 20 cm's. Faced this a few times in my life and the first thoughts of books & boxes are never a good idea.

Spotted some railway sleepers in her Dad's garden, with a wink, a smile and gentle kinda words i were loading these into the car.

Not difficult to do, its a sleeper bench laid on it's side essentially and made using 2 Mortice & Tenon joints. I decided to do this 'biblical' style, no power tools. Thoroughly enjoyed it but next time i'll be pluging my tools in.
